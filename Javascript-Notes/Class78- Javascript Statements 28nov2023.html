=========================== JavaScript	Statements ============================
	
Special Operators in JavaScript

- Ternary Operator ?:
- typeof
- instanceof
- delete
- in
- new
- void

                            yield
- It is used to return the result of an generator function.

Syntax:
    function* Generator()
    {
       yield  value;
    }

                        JavaScript Statements

- In computer programming statements are used to control the execution flow.
- Statements are classified into various groups

    1. Selection Statements
        if, else, switch, case, default
		
    2. Looping Control Statements
        for, while, do while
		
    3. Iteration Statements
        for..in, for..of
		
    4. Jump Statements
        break, return, continue
		
    5. Exception Handling Statements
        try, catch, throw, finally

Looping Control Statements
- Looping is the process of executing a set of statements repeatedly based on given condition.

- Loop can be created using : for, while & do while.
- Every loop requires initialization, condition and counter.

        initialization    => where to start
        condition        => when to stop
        counter        => how to move [ next / pervious / step ]

For Loop:
- It is looping control statement used by developers when they are sure about the number of iterations and the iteration counter will not change dynamically.

Syntax:
    for(initialization; condition; counter)
    {
       // statements;
    }

    Initialization    => It is required to define where to start and remember how many
                     times the loop executed.
                     Ex:
                    var i = 1
   
    Condition        => It is a boolean expression that checks the value and compares
                     with the desired condition, loop executes based on condition.

                     A loop stops when condition evaluates to false.
                    Ex:
                    i < = 10
   

    Counter        =>  It configures the step value to move the looping counter
                      next or previous.
                     Ex:
                    i++
                    i--
                    i = i + 5
                    i = i - 5

Ex:
    for(var i=1;  i<=5  ; i++)
    {
         console.log("Hello !");
    }

Ex:
     for(var i=1; i<=10; i++)
     {
     console.log(i);
     }

Ex:
    var i = 1;
    for( ; i<=10; i++)
    {
       console.log(i);
    }

Note: for statement requires memory for initialization, condition and counter. But it can be configured outside the parenthesis "( )".

Ex: Multiplication Table

<script>
    var n = parseInt(prompt("Enter a Number"));
    for(var i=1; i<=10; i++){
        document.write(`${n} X ${i} = ${n*i} <br>`);
    }
</script>

Q: How to print the given pattern?

    *
    *   *
    *   *    *
    *   *    *    *
    *   *    *    *    *

Q: Write a program to print factorial of given number.

    var n = parseInt(prompt("Enter number"));
     5
               5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120


Ex:
<script>
   var categories = ["All", "Electronics", "Footwear", "Fashion"];
   for(var i=0; i<categories.length; i++){
      document.write(`${i+1}. ${categories[i]}<br>`);
   }
</script>
