=========================================== JavaScript ====================================================



- JavaScript is light weight interpreted and Just-in-Time [JIT] compiled programming language.
- Light weight allows to operate with less memory.
- Interpreted allows line by line translation.
- Compiled allows to translate all lines simultaneously at the same time.
- There are 2 types compiling techniques
    a) JIT (Just-in-Time)
    b) AoT (Ahead-of-Time)

- JIT translates Javascript in browser, when it is requested in browser.
- AOT translate JavaScript on server, before it is requested in browser.
- AOT requires explicit JavaScript compilers like "V8, Babel, Node" etc.
- JavaScript is a programming language that supports various programming approaches like
    a) Functional Programming
    b) Structural Programming
    c) Imperative Programming
    d) Object Oriented Programming etc..

Note: JavaScript is not an OOP language, It supports only few features of OOP.

- JavaScript is a programming language used in various layers and applications.
- JavaScript can be used
    a) Client Side                [with HTML]
    b) Server Side                [with Node JS]
    c) In Database            [with MongoDB]
    d) In Animation Tools        [with Flash, CAD Systems]

JavaScript Client Side:

- A script client side is required to reduce burden on server.
- It can improve the performance of application by managing various interaction client side.
- JavaScript can handle various interactions client side, which includes

    a) DOM Manipulation
        - Adding element to page
        - Removing element from page
        - Updating data into element
        - Configuring styles to element dynamically
        - Configuring events to element dynamically
    b) Validation
        - Verify user input
        - Validates the input
        - Reports if it is not according to requirements
    c)  Client Side Interactions
        - Managing client memory
        - Managing client devices
        - Managing Location
        - Sharing of data with other applications on client device

Issues with JavaScript as Language:

1. JavaScript is not a strongly typed language.

        var x = 10;        x is number
        x = "John";        valid

2. JavaScript is not implicitly strictly typed language.

        age = 22;            valid

3. JavaScript is not structured in handling data. [Schema less]

        [  
          { Name: "TV",  Price: 45000.44 },
          { Product:"Mobile", Cost: 12000.33}
        ]

4. JavaScript is not an OOP language, It have issues with
        a) Code Extensibility
        b) Code Level Security
        c) Dynamic Polymorphism etc..

5. JavaScript is not secured and can be blocked by browser


Solution:
- You can use "TypeScript" as alternative
- It is strongly typed
- It is strictly typed
- It is an OOP language.
