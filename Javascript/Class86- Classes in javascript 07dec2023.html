                              Class in OOP
- Class is a program template that provides data and logic, which you can implement and customize according to requriements.
- Class have the behavior of Entity when it comprises of business related interactions.
- Class have the behavior of Model when it comprises of data related interactions.
- Class is used as a blue print to customize and create multiple copies according to the requirements.


Configuring a class in JavaScript:

a) Declaration

        class   Name
        {

        }

b) Expression

        var  Name = class {

        }


Class Members:
- JavaScript classes support only following members

    a) Property
    b) Method
    c) Accessor
    d) Constructor

FAQ: Can we define a variable as class member?
Ans : No. But you can have a variable in class as a member of any method.

FAQ: Why variable can't be a class member?
Ans : It is immutable and class can have only mutable members.


                         Property in Class

- A property in class is used to store data.
- It is mutable, which can change according to state and situation.

Syntax:
        class  Name
        {
            PropertyName = Value;
        }

- A property can handle any type of data
       
        a) Primtive
        b) Non Primitive
        c) Date

- You have to create an instance for class in order to access the class members.

Syntax:
        class Product
        {
            Name;
            Price;
        }

        let  tv = new Product();
        tv.Name = "Samsung TV";

Ex:
<script>
    class Product
    {
        Name = "";
        Price = 0;
        Stock = false;
        Cities = [];
        Rating = {Rate:0, Count:0}
    }
    let tv = new Product();
    tv.Name = prompt("Enter Name");
    tv.Price = parseFloat(prompt("Enter Price"));
    tv.Stock = (prompt("Enter Stock Status", "true|false")==="true"?true:false);
    for(var i=0; i<2; i++){
        tv.Cities[i] = prompt(`Enter City-${i+1}`);
    }
    tv.Rating.Rate = parseInt(prompt("Enter Rating"));
    tv.Rating.Count = parseInt(prompt("Enter Rating Count"));

    console.log(JSON.stringify(tv));
</script>


                              Accessors
- Accessors are used to configure fine grained control over properties.
- Accessor can manage read and write operations on a property.
- Every property comprises of 2 accessors
   
        a) get()            Getter
        b) set()            Setter

- Getter is used to read and return the value defined in property.
- Setter is used to store a new value into property.

Syntax:
        Property;
   
        get  AliasName()
        {
           return  this.Property;
        }

        set  AliasName(newValue)
        {
          this.Property = newValue;
        }

Ex:
<script>
    var userName = prompt("Enter Your Name");
    var userRole = prompt("Enter Your Role", "admin|customer");
    var productname = prompt("Enter New Name for Product");
    class Product
    {
        _productName;
        get ProductName()
        {
            return this._productName;
        }
        set ProductName(newName)
        {
            if(userRole==="admin")
            {
                this._productName = newName;
            }
            else
            {
                document.write(`Hello ! ${userName} you are not authorized to set product name`);
            }
        }
    }
    let tv = new Product();
    tv.ProductName = productname;
    if(tv.ProductName)
    {
        document.write(`Product Name : ${tv.ProductName}`);
    }
</script>
