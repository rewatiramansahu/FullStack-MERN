=============================== JavaScript Variables and Data Types ==================================

JavaScript Variables
- declaring
- assigning
- initialization
- var

let:
- It defines a block scope variable.
- Block scope uses a closure technique.
- Closure allows the members of outer block accessible to inner block.
- It is accessible with in the block where it is declared and its inner blocks.
- It allows declaring, initialization and assignment.
- It will not allow shadowing and hoisting.

const:
- It defines a block scope variable.
- It allows only initialization.
- It will not allow declaring and assigning.
- It will not allow hoisting and shadowing.

FAQ: Can a const variable change its value?
Ans: Yes. At the time of initializing memory.

FAQ: Is const and readonly same?
Ans: No. readonly can't change but const can change.

Global Scope for variable:
- Global scope allows a variable to access from any function.
- Global scope is technically "Module Scope".
- Module scope refers to <script> area.

Syntax:
    <script>
        // module scope
        function f1()
        {
           // function scope
        }
        // module scope
    </script>

- You can declare a global variable using var, let or const by configuring it at module scope.

Ex:
<script>
   
   let y = 20;
   const z = 30;
   var x = 10;
   function f1(){
     
     document.write("function-1 <br> x=" + x + "<br>y=" + y + "<br>z=" + z + "<br>");
   }
   function f2(){
    document.write("function-2 <br> x=" + x + "<br>y=" + y + "<br>z=" + z + "<br>");
   }
   f1();
   f2();
</script>

FAQ: Can we define a variable in function and make it global in access?
Ans: Yes. It is possible by configuring variable as "window" variable.
         [It is possible only for javascript in browser]

Syntax:
        window.variableName = value;

        document.write(variableName);
Ex:
<script>
   "use strict";
   let y = 20;
   const z = 30;
 
   function f1(){
     window.x = 5;
     document.write("function-1 <br> x=" + x + "<br>y=" + y + "<br>z=" + z + "<br>");
   }
   function f2(){
    document.write("function-2 <br> x=" + x + "<br>y=" + y + "<br>z=" + z + "<br>");
   }
   f1();
   f2();
</script>

FAQ: What is local and global scope?
Ans:  local refers to function & block.
     global refers to module.

Variable Naming Rules:
- It must start with an alphabet.
- You can start with "_" symbol but special characters are not recommended.
- It can be alpha numeric with special characters, but avoid special characters.
   
        var 2023Sales;        // invalid
        var Sales2023;        // valid
        var Sales 2023;        // invalid
        var Sales.2023;        // invalid
        var Sales_2023;        // valid
        var _2023Sales;        // valid

- It can't be a keyword.

        var while;            // invalid
        var class;            // invalid

- It's max length must be upto 255 chars only.
- It must speak what it is.
- It is recommended to use "Camel Case".

        var u = "John";            // Not Good
        var userName = "John";        // Good

        var studentName;
        var studentFee;

        var _productName;     => Not yet implemented

           
                        JavaScript Data Types

- Data Type defines complete data structure [DS].
- It is about the type, range and behaviour.
- JavaScript can handle various types of data in memory.
- The data types are classified into 2 categories

    1. Primitive Types
    2. Non-Primitive Types

Primitive Types:
- They are immutable types.
- Immutable mean's structure can't be changed.
- They have a fixed range for value.
- Value range can't change.
- They are stored in memory stack.
- Stack uses LIFO [Last-in First-out] mechanism.
- JavaScript Primitive types are

    1. Number
    2. String
    3. Boolean
    4. Null
    5. Undefined
    6. Symbol
    7. Bigint
