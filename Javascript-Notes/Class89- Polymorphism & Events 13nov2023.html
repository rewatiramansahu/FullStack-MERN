===================== Polymorphism and Events =====================

Aggregation    : Has-A-Relation
Inheritance    : Is-A-Relation

                            Polymorphism
- The term "Poly" refers to "Many" and "Morphos" means "Forms".
- Polymorphism allows a component to work for various situations.
- In technical terms a single super class object can use the memory of multiple derived classes, which resembles "Polymorphism".

Syntax:
    let obj = new Array(new Class1(), new Class2(), ...);

            FirstName;
            LastName;
            Designation;
            Print(){
                document.write(`${this.FirstName} ${this.LastName} - ${this.Designation}<br>`);
            }
        }
        class Developer extends Employee
        {
            FirstName = "Raj";
            LastName = "Kumar";
            Designation = "Developer";
            Role = "Developer Role : Build, Debug, Test, Deploy";
            Print(){
                super.Print();
                document.write(`${this.Role}`);

        class Manager extends Employee

                            Browser Events

- Event is a message sent by sender to its subscriber in order to notify the change.
- Event follows a software design pattern called "Observer", which is a communication pattern.
- Sender Sends a notification to Subscriber.
- Subscriber comprises of actions to perform when notified.

        function InsertClick()        => Subscriber
        {
        }

        <button onclick="InsertClick()">    => Sender

- Event uses a "Delegate" mechanism, which is a function pointer.
- It is not calling the function, it is pointing towards the function.

Event Handler:
- Event handler defines the actions to perform on specific element trigger.

        onclick                => Event
        onclick="InsertClick()"    => Event Handler

Event Listener:
- It allows to bind any event to element dynamically.
- It enables clean separation of code and design.

    document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", function(){

    })

EX:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <script>
        function bodyload(){
            document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", function(){
                 alert("Button CLicked");
            })
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body onload="bodyload()">
    <button>Insert</button>
