Type Script
- Typescript is strictly typed mode of Javascript.
- It is strongly typed language.
- It is an OOP language.
- "Anders Hejlberg" is the architect of Typescript.
   [Well known for C# language]
- Typescript belongs to Microsoft.
- Typescript is built with Typescript.
- It support low level features.
- It is used to build large scale applications with Microsoft technologies.
- Typescript is transcompiled into Javascript in browser.

TypeScript  Architecture:

1. Core Compiler    : It is responsible for translating typescript program into OS native
                  code. It tracks the errors and reports to develover.
                  - core.ts            It is the base for compiling
                  - program.ts        It configure the execution flow
                  - parser.ts        It converts one type into another
                  - scanner.ts        It manages input actions
                  - emitter.ts        It manages output actions    
                  - checker.ts        It handles data structure

2. Standalone TS Compiler:  It is responsible for translating TS program into Javascript.
                  - tsc.ts
                  - It is used only for web applications.
                  - It transcompiles TS into JS.


3. Language Service    : It is a pre-defined business logic provided by Typescript.
                      It is the repository of Typescript language, which is used
                      by the core compiler.
                      - service.ts

4. TS Server            : Typescript programs are hosted and processed on server.
                      It have an internal server managed by "server.ts"


5. VS Shim            : Visual Studio Shim is a library from Microsoft used to make
                      the Typescript language "Platform Neutral".
                      - shims.ts

6. Managed Language Service:  It is the language service used to make Typescript
                             understandable to every OS.
   
                             The un-managed code is OS specific &  Managed code
                              is cross platform.


Setup Typescript on your PC:

1. Open windows command prompt

2. Run the command

    C:\>npm  install  -g   typescript

3. Check the version

     C:\> tsc  -v
         5.3.3

4. Typescript programs have extention ".ts" and they are trans compiled into JS.

                    index.ts
          console.log("welcome to typescript");
     
    > tsc   index.ts                // generates  index.js
    > node index.js
